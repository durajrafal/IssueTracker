> ### Note
> My main focus when I started this project was backend. However I decided to implement also frontend to make it more enjoyable to explore. I chose razor views as a simple default solution. In some places I wanted to have more interactive functionality so I used Typescript and created API endpoints to fulfill this. That's why I ended up with some mix-up of both kind of endpoints. I'm aware that better and cleaner solution would be to create a REST API and have separate frontend project. I've made this sacrifice so I could focus mostly on backend before learning any of frontend frameworks, while still having some decent GUI.

## How to run locally
Please clone this repository and open in Visual Studio 2022.
### Configuration
#### DB config
If you're on Windows and have *localdb* installed you should be good to go. Otherwise, please change `"ConnectionStrings":"DefaultConnection"` in `appsettings.json` to point to MS SQL server of your choice.
#### SendGrid config
Application is using [SendGrid API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/). Setting it up in `appsettings.json` with your credentials is required for Registration/Password recovery to work properly.
